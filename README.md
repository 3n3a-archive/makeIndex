# makeIndex

Creates an Index of the files in a Git Repository and subsequently outputs this information in an HTML-File, for easy publishing on a static file hoster. An example of this would be GitHub-Pages.

This is a template repo, which can be used for generating index.html files in each directory of _files/_. This is being actively used to host my pdf colleciton :). 

## Usage

Use this as template repo and start uploading files and directories to _files/_. Afterwards deploy this to github pages and select the _main_ branch as source :).
